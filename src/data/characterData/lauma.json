Thus were the hymns known as Runo — imbued with power and sacred authority — established as the very foundation of magic.\\nThough the words of those first incantations are now lost to time, their melodies — and the memories woven within them — have been passed down, and the powers they awaken, though faint, remain capable of stirring change.</i>",
