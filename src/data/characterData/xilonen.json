Xilonen switches to high-speed combat blading gear and rushes forward a certain distance before dealing Nightsoul-aligned <span style=\"color: #FFE699FF;\">Geo DMG</span> based on her DEF.\\nAfter using this, Xilonen will gain 45 Nightsoul points and enter the Nightsoul's Blessing state. In this state, she will shift to the Blade Roller mode.\\n\\n<span style=\"color: #FFD780FF;\">Source Samples</span>\\nXilonen has 3 Samplers with her that can generate different Soundscapes based on her other party members' Elemental Types, decreasing nearby opponents' corresponding Elemental RES while active.\\nThe initial recorded Source Sample within each Sampler will be <span style=\"color: #FFE699FF;\">Geo</span>, and for each party member who is <span style=\"color: #FF9999FF;\">Pyro</span>/<span style=\"color: #80C0FFFF;\">Hydro</span>/<span style=\"color: #99FFFFFF;\">Cryo</span>/<span style=\"color: #FFACFFFF;\">Electro</span>, 1 <span style=\"color: #FFE699FF;\">Geo</span> Sample will change to that corresponding Element.\\nWhile Xilonen is in the Nightsoul's Blessing state, the <span style=\"color: #FFE699FF;\">Geo</span> Source Sample she carries will always be active. After unlocking her Passive Talent, \"Netotiliztli's Echoes,\" Xilonen can trigger said Passive Talent's effects to regenerate Nightsoul points for herself. When her Nightsoul points hit the maximum, she will consume all her Nightsoul points and activate the 3 Source Samples she has on hand for 15s.\\nWhen the Source Samples are active, nearby opponents' corresponding Elemental RES will decrease. Source Sample effects of the same Elemental Type cannot stack. Xilonen can trigger these effects even when off-field.\\n\\n<span style=\"color: #FFD780FF;\">Nightsoul's Blessing: Xilonen</span>\\nContinuously consume Nightsoul points. When these points are depleted or if used again, this Nightsoul's Blessing state will end. This state has the following traits:\\n·Switches to the Blade Roller mode, increasing Xilonen's Movement SPD and climbing speed, and she can perform high-speed leaps in Ocelot Form while climbing.\\n·Xilonen's Nightsoul's Blessing has the following restrictions: When in this state, Xilonen's Nightsoul points have a 9s time limit. After this limit passes, her Nightsoul points will immediately expire.\\n\\nAfter Xilonen's Nightsoul points have expired while she is in the Nightsoul's Blessing state, she will no longer be able to generate Nightsoul points via the Passive Talent \"Netotiliztli's Echoes.\"\\n\\n<i>In some ways, gem-craft and music-mixing share similar principles: Filtering out impurities and retaining only the most radiant things.\\nXilonen isn't picky about the two, however. She enjoys both immensely, after all!</i>",
