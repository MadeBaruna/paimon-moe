        tip: 'Klee has access to a number of animation cancels that allow her to deal damage with her talents faster than normal. \n\nHer N1 can be canceled through holding a directional key while clicking attack. This can be chained over and over again to produce a "machine gun" effect.\n\nHer optimal combos include N1C and N2C. N1C is higher DPS but eats stamina faster, while N2C has more consistency in keeping enemies stunned and gives a higher chance of obtaining her A1 passive onto the following CA.',

Check out the in-depth guide to learn in-depth about animation cancelling which may help with this issue.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choice:\nMemory of Dust: </b>This weapon's rankings assume that Klee is played without a shielder, as forcing a shielder for the additional 20 ATK% leads to a damage loss compared to her best teams, even if said shielder is Zhongli. If in a situation where Klee is played with a shielder anyway, this weapon would be on par with <b>Skyward Atlas</b>.\n<b>Solar Pearl: </b>When using <b>Solar Pearl</b>, it is recommended to animation cancel a Normal Attack into an Elemental Skill and cancel that into her Elemental Burst at the start of her field time.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets:</b>\n<b>Lavawalker (4): </b>Klee's kit makes it harder to utilize Vaporize and Melt the same way another pyro carry would, but her constant pyro application makes <b>Lavawalker (4)</b> a viable set. See KleefulFrame's great number breakdown <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JJZPMoNOqXhX8Ez1cl63fNXESJZXx7kQaJEeQ-WLOEY/edit\">here.</a>\n<b>Crimson Witch of Flames (4): </b>This set is only recommended in a team where Klee is able to trigger Vaporize consistently.\n<b>Wanderer's Troupe (4): </b>Wanderer's Troupe increases the Charged Attack by another 35% Damage Bonus. It can serve as a decent DPS choice but due to how clunky Klee's attack animations are, it's hard to put this in actual practice as it requires you to dodge more and consume more stamina, not to mention how the DPS gets caught up by the other builds mentioned above.",

Additionally, the RNG nature of its procs makes it unreliable in Vaporize teams as you can't guarantee it working on N1, N3 and N5 (her vaporized hits). \n<b>Retracing Bolide (4): </b>This set is only recommended to be used <b>with a shielder.</b> This set is also very <b>resin inefficient, </b>so its not recommended to farm for this set specifically.\n<b>Crimson Witch of Flames (2) +18% ATK set (2):</b> While lacking in power compared to the other options, you will likely have good substats on the 2 piece combinations compared to a full 4 piece set which can compensate.\n\n<b>Regarding Mainstats:\nElemental Mastery:</b> A good option if Yoimiya is <b>triggering Vaporize and/or Overload.</b> Having Bennett in the team favours Elemental Mastery sands slightly more than ATK sands, however it is recommended to just use whichever has better substats.\n\n<b>Regarding Talent Priorities: \n</b>Her Skill has poor scaling which results in individual upgrades not affecting your damage much. Her Burst is also low priority due to it being used once every few rotations in some scenarios (such as when using <b>Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)</b> without an abundance of off field energy) which can reduce its effectiveness.\n\n",

Note that you should do a Normal Attack when you swap in and before you swap out of Yae Miko to keep good uptime on the passive.\n<b>The Widsith: In Aggravate teams specifically,</b> <b>this weapon ranks much higher</b> and can outperform the 5 stars. Otherwise, it is recommended to use the other options above Widsith for more consistent damage.\n<b>Hakushin Ring: </b>This weapon's passive can buff your other team members, which <b>may be more beneficial than Yae Miko's personal damage</b> depending on the team and rotation used. Note that the passive cannot be triggered when off-field. <b>\nRegarding Artifact Choices:</b>\n<b>Emblem of Severed Fate (4): </b>This set works best for Yae in <b>multi-target scenarios where her Elemental Burst hits multiple enemies.</b> This set also<b> provides more value</b> if she's<b> </b>used WITHOUT Raiden<b> (due to the higher ER requirements).\nGilded Dreams (4):</b> If Yae is used in an <b>aggravate/quicken focused team</b>, this set will outperform <b>Emblem of Severed Fate (4)</b>.\n<b>+18% ATK set (2) / Thundering Fury (2) / Emblem of Severed Fate (2): </b>Using a combination of these artifact sets works best for Yae in <b>single-target scenarios.</b> These also<b> provide more value</b> if she's paired WITH Raiden<b> (due to lower ER requirements). </b>\n<b>Thundersoother (4): </b>Assuming you are able to maintain 100% uptime on its passive, this is Yae's BiS set. This set works best for Yae in Electro-charged teams.\n<b>Tenacity of the Milelith (4): </b>This set trades off a portion of Yae's damage in return for a party wide 20 ATK% buff. If you have good pieces as a result of farming Pale Flame (for Eula or otherwise) this can be a good option for her.<b> Not recommended to specifically farm this set for Yae.</b>\n\n<b>Regarding Talent Priority: </b> Do note that Yae's Elemental Burst does more damage than her Elemental Skill when it hits multiple enemies, and in some setups requiring high ER its more efficient to simply ult every second rotation rather than try to stack enough ER substats.\n\nBig thanks to <b>Fob#6835</b> for helping us with the weapon/artifact rankings.\n\n",

        note: "Kamisato Ayaka is a pretty straightforward DPS that <b>deals most of her damage from her Elemental Burst</b>. She has very high scalings on her burst at the cost of it being 80 energy. You will likely need<b> another Cryo battery on the team </b>to provide energy for her (Diona, Kaeya, Rosaria, etc). She has a <b>special dash</b> (like Mona) and after she dashes, she will get a Cryo infusion on her Normal Attacks. Ensure you always have this bonus active to maximise your rotation damage.\n\n<b>Regarding Main Stats Priority:\n</b>Circlet main stat will be dependant on your overall stats, depending on your overall stats, one can be better than the other. Since Ayaka is able to get a lot of Crit Value from <b>Blizzard Strayer (4)</b> set, ascension passive, and also possibly weapons, ATK circlets can be competitive to Crit ones, it also has a better drop rate, so don't throw away your good ATK circlets.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:</b>\n<b>Primordial Jade Cutter:</b> With <b>Blizzard Strayer (4)</b> and Cryo Resonance, this weapon overcrits, so try to avoid getting Crit Rate substats.\n<b>Aquila Favonia:</b> While <b>Aquila Favonia</b> has Physical Damage% as a main stat, which is basically useless on Ayaka, it is still a good statstick as it has a high base ATK and ATK% buff from the passive, however, it's not a huge upgrade over the other 4 star options and there might be a character which can utilize this weapon better (such as Bennett).\n<b>Skyward Blade: </b>The Energy Recharge main stat provided from this sword makes Ayaka comfortable in terms of having a good burst uptime, try to avoid getting Energy Recharge substats since the weapon already provides you with enough Energy Recharge.\n<b>Amenoma Kageuchi: </b>Lowers Ayaka's Energy Recharge requirement which allows her to allocate some of her Energy Recharge substats to other offensive substats. This weapon is also free and craftable while being competitive with other 4 star and even some 5 star weapons as well on the list.\n<b>Blackcliff Longsword: </b>Due to Ayaka's burst snapshotting, her burst is unable to benefit from the ATK buff from this weapon's passive on the first rotation (since you cast it immediately before defeating an opponent).\n<b>Harbinger of Dawn: </b>A good Crit statstick if you can keep the requirements up (having >90% HP).\n\nCrit Rate loses value here assuming you're running Blizzard Strayer (4), if you're not using that artifact set, then it has the same priority as Crit DMG (You still want to aim for 1:2 ratio in the end)",

If you want to furthermore buff your main DPS, you can give this sword to Jean as she can trigger <b>Freedom-Sworn's</b> skill relatively easily since Anemo is always trigger. \n<b>Lion's Roar: </b>Depending on passive uptime, it can be ranked over <b>Favonius</b> <b>Sword</b> (at 50% uptime) and even <b>Aquila</b> <b>Favonia </b>(at 100% uptime).\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets:\nViridescent Venerer (4): </b>The bread and butter for Anemo characters in general, as it is <b>commonly used for the 40% elemental resistance shred.\nNoblesse Oblige (4):</b> Another option for providing utilities to the team. This set gives a 20% partywide ATK boost after Jean casts her Elemental Burst.\n<b>Ocean-Hued Clam (4): </b>The best set for Jean's personal damage, as the damage it deals scales with Jean's burst healing. However, because Jean's total damage output is on the low end, it is generally recommended to prioritize utility options such as <b>Noblesse Oblige (4)</b> or <b>Viridescent Venerer (4)</b> over this set.\n\n<b>Regarding Main Stats Priority:</b>\nElemental Mastery should only be used <b>when Jean is paired with Bennett</b>, as her burst ticks will swirl the self applied Pyro from Bennett's burst, acting as a damage source and Pyro application. Because of this, high burst uptime is required and so weapons with EM and ER passives are preferred. <b>(Freedom Sworn, Skyward Blade,  Favonius Sword, Sacrificial Sword, Iron Sting, Amenoma Kageuchi)\n</b>\n<b>Regarding Talent Priorities: \n</b>If you prefer more damage than healing, prioritize Elemental Skill over Elemental Burst since it scales better.\nFor Support Jean, you can either go for more ATK for stronger heals, but relatively lower Burst uptime, or more ER for lower heals, but higher Burst uptime. Choosing between these two is up to personal preference, although if another Anemo character is on the team, Jean has very little energy problem and can potentially go full Sub DPS build.\n\n",

This allows his teammates to gain the 3 Geo 15% Geo DMG% bonus for a longer duration, so it's preferable to use Burst as your last ability before swapping into your DPS.",
        note: "Gorou is a Support character that can give increasing buffs to your party members from his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst based on the number of Geo characters in your team (capped at 3). Casting his Elemental Skill sets up a banner which gives flat DEF (1 Geo), Interruption Resistance (2 Geo) and Geo DMG% Bonus (3 Geo) for your active character standing inside the banner radius. Casting his Elemental Burst creates a field following the active character which deals periodic damage and offers the same bonuses given by the Skill, destroying any placed banners in the process, it also pulls in nearby Elemental Shards created by Crystallize reactions. Due to his kit focusing on buffing DEF and Geo DMG, he's a specialised support geared towards Geo DPS that scales with DEF, such as Noelle or Itto. He can see niche use at <b>[C6]</b> with other Geo characters as well.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:</b>\n<b>Elegy for the End:</b> Elegy offers a helpful ER substat alongside an EM and ATK% buff for your teammates. While not directly useful in teams centered around Noelle or Itto, this could possibly be a good choice for future Geo DPS characters, or in a team which utilizes Geo Resonance.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets:</b>\n<b>The Exile (4): </b>Casting Elemental Burst regenerates a total of 6 Energy for each of your party member. This set reduces your Energy Requirements by a bit for all of your party members, which can be quite beneficial. Do note that this is a 4 star set so you're potentially missing out on 5 star stat scaling, which is a 34% difference in mainstat value and 25% difference in individual substat value.\n<b>Noblesse Oblige (4): </b>The effectiveness of this set increases if you've already met the ER requirement for Gorou. At that point, you'd no longer need to run the recommended ER% sets, which means you can opt for this instead. \n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Mainstats and Substats Priority:</b>\n<b>DEF% mainstats and substats</b> (and potentially a <b>Healing Bonus</b> mainstat on Circlet) can be considered at<b> [C4]</b> due to being able to heal the active character based on his DEF during burst. This is useful if you plan to use him as a solo healer.\n<b>Crit Rate circlet and substats</b> can be considered when Gorou is using <b>Favonius Warbow</b> to trigger the passive comfortably.\n<b>ER% substats can usually be more important than getting the right mainstat</b>, as Gorou's damage contribution to a team is negligible, while being able to get Energy for his Burst is a lot more important.",

        note: "Albedo is a character that can summon a Geo Construct from his Elemental Skill which deals damage on a 2 second interval whenever enemies in the field are damaged. His Elemental Burst provides 125 EM to the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn't benefit from the 125 EM buff. Another option is to build him with ATK-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher Burst damage.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:</b>\n<b>Harbinger of Dawn:</b> Albedo's Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Base ATK from the weapon doesn't matter that much. <b>Harbinger of Dawn</b> offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you'd need to keep Albedo's HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.\n<b>Mistsplitter Reforged</b>: Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon's passive and this requires setup. Generally just use <b>Harbinger of Dawn </b>instead and give your <b>Mistsplitter Reforged</b> to another sword DPS character.\n<b>Freedom-Sworn:</b> Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo's own damage significantly but he is one of the better <b>Freedom-Sworn</b> holders since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other party members.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets:</b>\n<b>Husk of Opulent Dreams (4):</b> Due to Albedo's skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait ~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF and Geo DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.\n<b>Tenacity of the Milelith (4):</b> This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.\n<b>Noblesse Oblige (4):</b> If you don't have another character in your party that has this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst uptime for this. It is also worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Substats Priority:</b>\nATK and Energy Recharge substats are only valuable on a Hybrid Albedo that casts his Elemental Burst.",

        note: "Arataki Itto is a Geo DPS Character who takes advantage of his Elemental Burst's ATK boost and Geo infusion to deal significant damage during its uptime. His combos involve stacking and unleashing his Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesagiri consumes no stamina and can be casted continuously as long as he has Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is capped at 5 stacks at any given time, and Itto gets those stacks when his 2nd and 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy. Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st and 3rd Normal Attack to also generate stacks. Itto's Elemental Skill deals damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1 Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field, Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto's Elemental Burst converts his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo DMG, increases Itto's Normal Attack Speed and converts a portion of Itto's current DEF to ATK.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:</b>\n<b>Serpent Spine:</b> When using <b>Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine</b> stacks are prioritized over <b>Husk of the Opulent Dreams</b> stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).\n<b>Skyward Pride: </b>Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your ER needs. The less Energy Recharge you need (due to particle generation from your party members or ER from subs), the less useful this weapon becomes.\n<b>Whiteblind</b>: Your rotations often start with 1 stack of this weapon, and due to Itto's Burst snapshotting DEF on cast, you're unable to take advantage of further DEF% from the stacks.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets: </b>\n<b>Retracting Bolide (4):</b> This set grants you an additional 40% Normal and Charged Attack DMG when shielded. Crystallize can be unreliable so a consistent shielder is preferred, such as Zhongli.",
