Check out the in-depth guide to learn in-depth about animation cancelling which may help with this issue.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choice:\nMemory of Dust: </b>This weapon's rankings assume that Klee is played without a shielder, as forcing a shielder for the additional 20 ATK% leads to a damage loss compared to her best teams, even if said shielder is Zhongli.

It can serve as a decent DPS choice but due to how clunky Klee's attack animations are, it's hard to put this in actual practice as it requires you to dodge more and consume more stamina, not to mention how the DPS gets caught up by the other builds mentioned above.",

While using both Yun Jin <b>and</b> Bennett, this weapon can potentially beat <b>Rust [R5]</b>.\n<b>Amos' Bow:</b> This weapon's ranking is assuming low stacks of its passive due to you ideally being close to enemies to consistently hit all attacks in your combo. When at 3 stacks, this weapon can be close to <b>Slingshot [R5]</b>. Use it if it's already built for another character and you don't want to invest in <b>Slingshot</b> just for Yoimiya.\n<b>Rust: </b>At <b>[R4]</b> this weapon performs better than <b>Polar Star</b>, and at <b>[R5] </b>performs better than <b>Aqua Simulacra.</b>\n\n<b>Regarding Artifacts:  \nShimenawa's Reminiscence (4): </b>This set is her Best in Slot in the vast majority of situations even when considering inconsistent Burst usage (once every 3-4 rotations).\n<b>Crimson Witch of Flames (4): </b>Usable in Vaporize teams and can be her Best in Slot for teams where she procs <b>Vaporize and Overload</b> (such as teams with a Fischl flex or Fischl + Beidou taser core)\n<b>Echoes of an Offering (4): </b>This set has a lot of caveats that generally warrant it being a subpar choice. Its effects proccing is tied to your connection to the servers, so<b> if your ping is above 100 and/or you have an unstable connection</b> (fluctuations), you should avoid this set. Additionally, the RNG nature of its procs makes it unreliable in Vaporize teams as you can't guarantee it working on N1, N3 and N5 (her vaporized hits). \n<b>Retracing Bolide (4): </b>This set is only recommended to be used <b>with a shielder.</b> This set is also very <b>resin inefficient, </b>so its not recommended to farm for this set specifically.\n<b>Crimson Witch of Flames (2) +18% ATK set (2):</b> While lacking in power compared to the other options, you will likely have good substats on the 2 piece combinations compared to a full 4 piece set which can compensate.\n\n<b>Regarding Mainstats:\nElemental Mastery:</b> A good option if Yoimiya is <b>triggering Vaporize and/or Overload.</b> Having Bennett in the team favours Elemental Mastery sands slightly more than ATK sands, however it is recommended to just use whichever has better substats.\n\n<b>Regarding Talent Priorities: \n</b>Her Skill has poor scaling which results in individual upgrades not affecting your damage much. Her Burst is also low priority due to it being used once every few rotations in some scenarios (such as when using <b>Shimenawa's Reminiscence (4)</b> without an abundance of off field energy) which can reduce its effectiveness.\n\n",

Other Hydro characters and Energy Recharge based teammates like Raiden Shogun can help alleviate his energy requirements, as does his <b>Constellation 6</b>.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:\nThe weapon rankings assume you are running enough Energy Recharge to get Xingqiu\'s burst up off cooldown. If you are not, select an Energy Recharge weapon from this list.</b>\n<b>Sacrificial Sword [R3+]:</b> This weapon is<b> extremely inconsistent </b>and <b>extends rotation lengths</b> leading to an <b>overall loss in DPS</b>. This weapon does become more useful if <b>Xingqiu is not the only hydro character on the team</b>.\n<b>Harbinger of Dawn [R5]</b>: At <b>[C6], </b>if you can consistently keep the passive active, this has the potential to rival <b>Sacrificial Sword [R3+]\nSapwood Blade: </b>This weapon can be especially useful as a support weapon in<b> Dendro based teams</b>.\n\nBig thanks to Quincy#6965 for helping us with the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wv1WXpkFkTX8SLCWLoQXlyxwnB2ZXZqQ6c9tSSVCAvQ/edit?usp=sharing">weapon calculations</a>.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets:\nEmblem of Severed Fate (4):</b> This set falls off in terms of damage if Xingqiu has less than <b>130% </b>Energy Recharge.\n<b>Noblesse Oblige (4): </b>Offers party-wide ATK boost, you can use this set on Xingqiu<b> if nobody else on the party is able to use it better</b>. If someone else on the team<b> already has Noblesse Oblige (4), Noblesse Oblige (4) should not be used.</b>\n<b>Blizzard Strayer (4): </b>This set is <b>only recommended on a freeze team</b> to optimize Xingqiu\'s stats since he can mildly disregard Crit Rate and build Crit Damage instead for more damage output. Despite it outperforming <b>Emblem of Severed Fate (4)</b> within this niche,<b> it is generally not recommended to specifically farm for this set.</b>\n\n<b>Regarding Main Stats Priority:</b>\nIdeally you would be running ATK% Sands when your ER needs are fulfilled. ER needs can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wv1WXpkFkTX8SLCWLoQXlyxwnB2ZXZqQ6c9tSSVCAvQ/edit?usp=sharing">Xingqiu Mastersheet</a>.\n\nPrioritize Energy Recharge first if you can\'t burst off cooldown',

On top of that, you can Reverse Melt all 3 hits of his Elemental Burst on enemies applied with strong Pyro, such as Bennett's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst.\n\nChongyun is <b>very niche</b> as he only performs well in certain teams and can completely destroy the other. He is mainly used on a team as an <b>enabler</b>, be it for <b>Reverse Melt teams</b> (e.g. Melt DPS Bennett) or <b>Freeze teams</b> (e.g. Freeze DPS Kaeya). He also <b>does not function well with Physical teams</b> (e.g. Razor, Eula) as it renders his Elemental Skill useless because it converts their <b>Normal Attack damage from Physical to Cryo</b>. They're usually using a Physical Goblet, so if they got their Normal Attack converted from Physical to Cryo, <b>they won't benefit from Physical DMG Bonus</b> from the goblet, thus it's a DPS loss.\n<b>\n</b>At<b> [C2]</b>, his Elemental Skill <b>reduces ability cooldown that is casted within the zone by 15%</b>. This is one of the few abilities in the game that can reduce cooldown.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:\nSerpent Spine:</b> This weapon outperforms <b>Wolf's Gravestone</b> if we only look at Chongyun's damage contribution <b>[5 Stacks Assumed]</b>. <b>Wolf's Gravestone</b> is ranked higher as it provides more teamwide DPS and does not come with the need to acquire stacks before engaging in combat.\n<b>Redhorn Stonethresher: </b>Depending on the amount of ATK% buffs you're getting, this weapon can overtake <b>Wolf's Gravestone</b> in personal damage.<b>\nAkuoumaru</b>: At <b>[R1]</b>, <b>Akuoumaru</b> beats <b>Luxurious Sea-Lord</b> if Chongyun is used in a team with <b>260 or greater</b> total team energy. <b>Akuoumaru</b> only beats <b>Luxurious Sea-Lord</b> if <b>[R2]</b> and above otherwise.\n<b>Sacrificial Greatsword: </b>This weapon is your best choice if faced in a situation where you heavily rely on Chongyun's Cryo infusion uptime.\n<b>\nRegarding Artifact Sets:\nNoblesse Oblige (4):</b> Chongyun is one of the best <b>Noblesse Oblige (4)</b> holders since he has low energy requirements for his Elemental Burst.\n\n<b>Regarding Talent Priority: \n</b>Prioritize Elemental Burst on a Melt team as it scales better than his Elemental Skill.\nPrioritize Elemental Skill on a Freeze team to furthermore extend the duration of the Cryo infusion.\n\n",

As such, at higher refines / more stacks on the passive, this weapon can perform better than <b>Skyward Blade,</b> while at lower refines / less stacks, it can perform worse.<b>\nFreedom-Sworn: </b>The ranking here only assumes Jean's personal damage and not the utility it gives. If you want to furthermore buff your main DPS, you can give this sword to Jean as she can trigger <b>Freedom-Sworn's</b> skill relatively easily since Anemo is always the trigger for a Swirl reaction. \n<b>Lion's Roar: </b>Depending on passive uptime, it can be ranked over <b>Favonius</b> <b>Sword</b> (at 50% uptime) and even <b>Aquila</b> <b>Favonia </b>(at 100% uptime).\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets:\nViridescent Venerer (4): </b>The bread and butter for Anemo characters in general, as it is <b>commonly used for the 40% elemental resistance shred.\nNoblesse Oblige (4):</b> Another option for providing utilities to the team. This set gives a 20% partywide ATK boost after Jean casts her Elemental Burst.\n<b>Ocean-Hued Clam (4): </b>The best set for Jean's personal damage, as the damage it deals scales with Jean's burst healing. However, because Jean's total damage output is on the low end, it is generally recommended to prioritize utility options such as <b>Noblesse Oblige (4)</b> or <b>Viridescent Venerer (4)</b> over this set.\n\n<b>Regarding Main Stats Priority:</b>\nElemental Mastery should only be used <b>when Jean is paired with Bennett</b>, as her burst ticks will swirl the self applied Pyro from Bennett's burst, acting as a damage source and Pyro application. Because of this, high burst uptime is required and so weapons with EM and ER passives are preferred. <b>(Freedom-Sworn, Skyward Blade,  Favonius Sword, Sacrificial Sword, Iron Sting, Amenoma Kageuchi)\n</b>\n<b>Regarding Talent Priorities: \n</b>If you prefer more damage than healing, prioritize Elemental Skill over Elemental Burst since it scales better.\nFor Support Jean, you can either go for more ATK for stronger heals, but relatively lower Burst uptime, or more ER for lower heals, but higher Burst uptime. Choosing between these two is up to personal preference, although if another Anemo character is on the team, Jean has very little energy problem and can potentially go full Sub DPS build.\n\n",

Having <b>Sacrificial Sword</b> or a second Anemo character in the team will also help reduce the needs for ER and prioritize EM substats more.\n<b>Favonius Sword: </b>With this weapon, try to aim for some Crit Rate stats to trigger the weapon passive reliably.\n<b>Xiphos' Moonlight:</b> In teams where you can meet energy requirements without needing the extra particles from <b>Favonius Sword</b> this is a better choice with stronger personal damage and buffing. Also at high refinements <b>[R4-R5]</b> it starts beating <b>Favonius Sword</b> in team energy generation too.\n<b>Iron Sting: </b>This weapon will yield the joint highest upfront EM and teamwide buff if compared to the other 4 star options,<b> if you manage to meet his energy needs or simply don't need more than one rotation, this would be the better option if compared to the Energy Recharge weapons.\nToukabou Shigure: </b>This weapon performs very similarly to<b> Iron Sting </b>in a <b>Swirl</b> focused build even at higher refinements since its passive does not effect <b>Swirl</b> damage.<b>\nAmenoma Kageuchi: </b>At <b>[R5]</b>, <b>Amenoma Kageuchi</b> needs no extra ER, and can focus building entirely EM.

This team triggers <b>multiple fall damage instances against enemies that can be Crowd Controlled by Kazuha.</b> Fischl can use <b>The Viridiscent Hunt</b> bow to allow for more fall damage instances. <b>**NOTE: This team performs very poorly in pure single target situations.</b>\n\nPrioritize Energy Recharge if his Energy Requirements are not met yet.\nFor an EM-focused build, upgrading Kazuha's talent levels isn't a necessity.

This allows his teammates to gain the 3 Geo 15% Geo DMG% bonus for a longer duration, so it's preferable to use Burst as your last ability before swapping into your DPS.",
        note: "Gorou is a Support character that can give increasing buffs to your party members from his Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst based on the number of Geo characters in your team (capped at 3). Casting his Elemental Skill sets up a banner which gives flat DEF (1 Geo), Interruption Resistance (2 Geo) and Geo DMG% Bonus (3 Geo) for your active character standing inside the banner radius. Casting his Elemental Burst creates a field following the active character which deals periodic damage and offers the same bonuses given by the Skill, destroying any placed banners in the process, it also pulls in nearby Elemental Shards created by Crystallize reactions. Due to his kit focusing on buffing DEF and Geo DMG, he's a specialised support geared towards Geo DPS that scales with DEF, such as Noelle or Itto. He can see niche use at <b>[C6]</b> with other Geo characters as well.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:</b>\n<b>Elegy for the End:</b> Elegy offers a helpful ER substat alongside an EM and ATK% buff for your teammates. While not directly useful in teams centered around Noelle or Itto, this could possibly be a good choice for future Geo DPS characters, or in a team which utilizes Geo Resonance.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets:</b>\n<b>The Exile (4): </b>Casting Elemental Burst regenerates a total of 6 Energy for each of your party member. This set reduces your Energy Requirements by a bit for all of your party members, which can be quite beneficial. Do note that this is a 4 star set so you're potentially missing out on 5 star stat scaling, which is a 34% difference in mainstat value and 25% difference in individual substat value.\n<b>Noblesse Oblige (4): </b>The effectiveness of this set increases if you've already met the ER requirement for Gorou. At that point, you'd no longer need to run the recommended ER% sets, which means you can opt for this instead. \n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Mainstats and Substats Priority:</b>\n<b>DEF% mainstats and substats</b> (and potentially a <b>Healing Bonus</b> mainstat on Circlet) can be considered at<b> [C4]</b> due to being able to heal the active character based on his DEF during burst. This is useful if you plan to use him as a solo healer.\n<b>Crit Rate circlet and substats</b> can be considered when Gorou is using <b>Favonius Warbow</b> to trigger the passive comfortably.\n<b>ER% substats can usually be more important than getting the right mainstat</b>, as Gorou's damage contribution to a team is negligible, while being able to get Energy for his Burst is a lot more important.",

Prioritize HP scaling polearms such as Black Tassel and artifact sets such as Tenacity of the Millelith (4) to capitalize on Zhongli's Shield. </b>Most of the time, especially on a HP-focused Zhongli, casting Elemental Burst is a DPS loss due to the cast time, which is why you'd only want to cast Elemental Burst for the Crowd Control it offers, and not for damage.\n\nNote that if paired with Xingqiu and/or Beidou, the damage reduction from orbitals from Xingqiu's Elemental Skill and Elemental Burst and/or Beidou's Elemental Burst can be utilized on Zhongli's shield, making it basically unbreakable.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Main Stats and Substats Priority:</b>\nCrit Rate should only be considered when Zhongli is equpping <b>Favonius Lance</b> to reliably proc the passive.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:\nFavonius Lance: </b>Use this weapon over <b>Black Tassel</b> if you value the team energy (Note that you need to build some amount of Crit Rate if you are running <b>Favonius Lance</b> to trigger the passive)\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact sets:\nArchaic Petra (4):</b> Can be more useful than <b>Tenacity of the Millelith (4)</b> in teams that <b>dont scale as well with ATK buffs or already have another Tenacity of the Millelith holder</b>. Though it can be an awkard set to utlize well without extending rotation times, since the Holder of the set (<b>Zhongli</b> in this case) has to pickup the shard for the buff to take effect.\n<b>Deepwood Memories (4): </b>This set works best in <b>Dendro reaction focused</b> teams <b>(Bloom/Burgeon/Hyperbloom/Spread)</b> that <b>prefer having Deepwood Memories on Zhongli</b> so that they can run more <b>damage focused sets such as Gilded Dreams / Flower of Paradise Lost</b> instead for the <b>highest overall damage gain</b>. That said it means <b>keeping the enemies near your pillar's </b>to have<b> good uptime on the Dendro resistance shred effect</b>, which can be <b>difficult with no grouping abilities</b> in a team.\n<b>Instructor (4): </b>This set is usually only used in a few <b>heavily reaction focused teams,</b> such as <b>Ganyu Melt or Hu Tao Vape,</b> where you're <b>maximising your damage in exchange for a stronger shield</b>.

        note: "Albedo is a character that can summon a Geo Construct from his Elemental Skill which deals damage on a 2 second interval whenever enemies in the field are damaged. His Elemental Burst provides 125 EM to the party, which is good on teams that rely on amplification reactions, such as Vaporize. It is worth noting that since his stat priority is focused on DEF (Elemental Skill scaling), you might want to skip casting Elemental Burst if your team doesn't benefit from the 125 EM buff. Another option is to build him with ATK-DEF Hybrid, which ends up with lower Skill damage but higher Burst damage.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:</b>\n<b>Harbinger of Dawn:</b> Albedo's Elemental Skill scales with Defense, which is why the Base ATK from the weapon doesn't matter that much. <b>Harbinger of Dawn</b> offers a lot of Crit stats which is why it is one of the strongest weapons for him despite being a 3 star weapon. The downside of this weapon is that you'd need to keep Albedo's HP at 90% or higher to benefit from the passive, so it might be annoying to use against certain enemies which has a HP lowering debuff, even when off-field, such as Corrosion.\n<b>Mistsplitter Reforged</b>: Realistically you are only able to get 2 stacks of this weapon's passive and this requires setup. Generally just use <b>Harbinger of Dawn </b>instead and give your <b>Mistsplitter Reforged</b> to another sword DPS character.\n<b>Freedom-Sworn:</b> Equipping this weapon will decrease Albedo's own damage significantly but he is one of the better <b>Freedom-Sworn</b> holders since he can trigger the passive quite easily to buff your other party members.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets:</b>\n<b>Husk of Opulent Dreams (4):</b> Due to Albedo's skill snapshotting upon cast, you need to either wait ~12 seconds before starting a domain/fight to reach max stacks or recast his skill to benefit from the DEF and Geo DMG bonus provided by the 4 piece set effect.\n<b>Tenacity of the Millelith (4):</b> This set is used for the 4 piece set effect which has good uptime on Albedo. Worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.\n<b>Noblesse Oblige (4):</b> If you don't have another character in your party that has this set, you can use this set on Albedo. You might want to get some Energy Recharge substats to maintain your Elemental Burst uptime for this. It is also worth noting that this set decreases your Elemental Skill damage by a lot if compared to the other offensive sets.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Substats Priority:</b>\nATK% and Energy Recharge substats are only valuable on a Hybrid Albedo that casts his Elemental Burst.",

        note: "Arataki Itto is a Geo DPS Character who takes advantage of his Elemental Burst's ATK boost and Geo infusion to deal significant damage during its uptime. His combos involve stacking and unleashing his Charged Attacks, named Arataki Kesagiri. Arataki Kesagiri consumes no stamina and can be casted continuously as long as he has Superlative Superstrength stacks. Superlative Superstrength is capped at 5 stacks at any given time, and Itto gets those stacks when his 2nd and 4th Normal Attack string hits an enemy. Activating his Elemental Burst allows his 1st and 3rd Normal Attack to also generate stacks. Itto's Elemental Skill deals damage to enemies on cast and summons a taunt, Ushi, which is considered a Geo Construct. This initial cast damage grants Itto 1 Superlative Superstrength stack, and upon Ushi leaving the field, Itto is granted another stack. When Ushi takes damage, Itto gains a stack (capped at 1 stack per 2 seconds). Itto's Elemental Burst converts his Normal and Charged Attacks into Geo DMG, increases Itto's Normal Attack Speed and converts a portion of Itto's current DEF to ATK.\n\n<b>Regarding Weapon Choices:</b>\n<b>Serpent Spine:</b> When using <b>Husk of Opulent Dreams, Serpent Spine</b> stacks are prioritized over <b>Husk of Opulent Dreams</b> stacks due to their conflicting nature in gaining stacks (Off-field and on-field).\n<b>Skyward Pride: </b>Can be a great or bad weapon for Itto depending on your ER needs. The less Energy Recharge you need (due to particle generation from your party members or ER from subs), the less useful this weapon becomes.\n<b>Whiteblind</b>: Your rotations often start with 1 stack of this weapon, and due to Itto's Burst snapshotting DEF on cast, you're unable to take advantage of further DEF% from the stacks.\n\n<b>Regarding Artifact Sets: </b>\n<b>Retracting Bolide (4):</b> This set grants you an additional 40% Normal and Charged Attack DMG when shielded. Crystallize can be unreliable so a consistent shielder is preferred, such as Zhongli.",
